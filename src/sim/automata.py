'''
	Automata is state by state
	Note: might be better to do this in C for speedup

	idea -- create reinforcement learning model
	- we have state, action
	- model learns to add points to the CA state to achieve some outcome
	- consider: ask agent to create a certain state, or some qualification using k moves
			- how does it do it

	- we need pattern detection
	- we need cycle detection
		- can we transform each image to a graph...
		- each state to a graph? 

	- some web server where you can pkay / analyze differnet automata setup
		- have the interactive code etc
		- need to port it all to JS
