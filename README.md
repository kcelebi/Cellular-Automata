# Cellular-Automata

by Kaya Celebi

This set of programs creates and simulates scenarios of Cellular Automata, particularly the Game of Life. If you are going to clone this project, note that filepaths in automata_brute.py and automata/automata.pde might have to be changed. The easiest demonstration to view is automata_brute.html. 

# automata_brute.html

This program is a JavaScript file that runs the Game of Life scenario. It can be simply double-clicked to open in a browser.

# automata_brute.py

This program generates various Game of Life scenarios and stores them into .txt files. It subsequently runs a Processing file that displays the simulation. It effectively does the same thing as automata_brute.html, however, in a different medium.

# Other Files
The remaining files are helper files that allow me to run various tests and calculate potential file sizes.
