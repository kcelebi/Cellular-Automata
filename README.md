This purpose of this project is to test different research ideas for cellular automata. This is in the form of hypotheses, demos, simulations, and unstructured trial/error. Some of these hypotheses are:

- How can we detect the self-producing cycles?
- Can a Reinforcement Learning Agent interact with a CA environment to create a desired state?


This set of programs creates and simulates scenarios of Cellular Automata, particularly the Game of Life. 

* Conway's Game of Life Interactive

    I am currently in the process of implementing an interactive demonstration where one can draw different pre-set patterns to a Game of Life simulation. The goal of this is to allow the user the ease of making new patterns, observing simulations of natural e
    phenomena, or discovering new features.

    View the interactive cellular automata demonstration [here](https://kcelebi.github.io/cellular-automata/visualize/inter.html)

* Cellular Automata Dataset

    Conway's Game of Life is not the only set of rules for Cellular Automata. I want to bridge some of my focus to other rules, such as rule 30, and perhaps create a dataset for the purpose of analyzing the different patterns that appear. This project is still in the planning stages


### automata

This is a processing file that, more or less, does the same thing as ``automata.html``. It uses the scenarios located in the ``scenarios`` folder to simulate.
